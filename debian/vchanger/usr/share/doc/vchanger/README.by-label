README.by-label

[DEPRECATED]  As of version 0.8.3, magazine partitions may be specified by
              filesystem UUID, allowing vchanger to query the OS to determine the
              device node and mountpoint. This ability makes udev changes largely
              unnecessary for most systems.

Many Linux distros include udev to provide dynamic device nodes supporting
hotpluging of devices. By default, udev creates a symlink in /dev/disk/by-label
for each attached disk partition that has a labeled file system, using the
file system label to name the symlink. The symlink points to the real device
node assigned by udev to the disk partition.

When two partitions share the same file system label, the by-label symlink will
point to the device node of the most recently attached partition, and there will
be no symlink pointing to previously attached partitions. This presents a bit of
a problem for using vchanger in multi-magazine mode, since all magazines
belonging to a particular autochanger will have the same file system label.

The 99-by-label-fix.rules and by-label-fix.sh files in the ./doc directory may be
used to fix this "problem" by adding udev rules to create a numbered symlink for
each partition's device node in addition to the default symlink based solely on
the file system label. For example, if two separate disk partitions have file
systems with the file system volume label "volname", then for the first partition
attached, udev will create symlink /dev/disk/by-label/volname.1 in addition to the
default symlink named /dev/disk/by-label/volname. When the second partition is
attached, udev will create symlink /dev/disk/by-label/volname.2 and overwrite the
default symlink.


Installing the by-label Fix

To install the new udev rules, copy the 99-by-label-fix.rules file to the udev
rules directory, usually located at /etc/udev/rules.d, copy the by-label-fix.sh
script to /usr/local/sbin, and then issue the command:
  []# /sbin/udevadm control --reload_rules
as root to load the new rules.
