This file explains general installation instructions. The documentation
included in the ./doc directory of the vchanger source archive should be
consulted instead.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using GNU autoconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.    Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
        ./configure --help   gives a list of possible options. Usually,
        the default options will suffice to install vchanger under the
        /usr/local directory.

        Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
        the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
        initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
        a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
        this:
                CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
        Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
                env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
        Or if you're using a non Bourne-compatible shell, you can do:
                sh -c 'CFLAGS="-O2 -g" ./configure

        A typical vchanger development configuration for Linux is:

        CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall" \
          ./configure

  2.    Carefully review the output from ./configure.  If it is not
        what you want, re-run the ./configure.  Often ./configure "caches"
        things and thus remembers the last ./configure options.  If you
        want to be sure you are starting fresh after a ./configure,
        do a:

            make distclean

        before re-running ./configure.  "make distclean" wipes out any
        knowledge of the ./configure, so don't do it after you have a
        configuration that suits your needs, otherwise the "make" will
        not work.

  3.    Build it
            make

  4.    Install it
            make install-strip

  5.    Create a autochanger configuration file and configure Bacula(TM)
        to use that autochanger. Please see the documentation in the
        ./doc directory for details.
